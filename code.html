  <label>You MIGHT be eligible for an exemption, but we need to undertake a more detailed assessment of your site to see if you eligible for a de minimis exemption.</label>
    <p>Based on the information you have provided, our preliminary assessment is that you may want to consider whether your development is eligible
for a de minimis exemption. However, to determine whether your development is eligible, we need to work out how many habitats your
development will "impact" as determined by the statutory biodiversity metric.</p> 
    <p> <strong>The good news is that we can undertake this assessment, online in under 45 minutes.</strong></p> 
    <p>Our tool can produce a bespoke BNG Exemption Report, which will allow you to demonstrate to your Local Planning Authority that you are
exempt and have undertaken an assessment of your duties under Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). The plan will include detailed reasons, a baseline and a post-development habitat map.</p>
    <p> <strong>Get a detailed BNG Exemption Report (£95)</strong></p>
    <p>(Only pay if you are exempt!)</p>
    <p>Note that Local Planning Authorities (LPAS) can still request that an application complies with BNG. Complying with BNG also enhances the local environment and can boost the chances of getting planning permission.</p>

    <p>Biodiversity Net Gain will not apply to Biodiversity Gain Sites. Article 7 of The Biodiversity Gain Requirements (Exemptions) Regulations 2024 states that "The biodiversity gain planning condition does not apply in relation to planning permission for development which is undertaken solely or mainly for the purpose of fulfilling, in whole or in part, the biodiversity gain planning condition which applies in relation to another development".</p>

     <label> Good News - Your Development Meets Key Criteria, Which Means We Can Help! </label>
    <p> Based on the details you've provided, our preliminary assessment is that your site might be entitled to a de minimis exemption. To confirm this, we need to undertake a 20-minute online assessment of your site to determine what impact your development will have on local habitats.</p> 
<p><strong>Next Steps: </strong></p>
 <p><strong>Start the online assessment:</strong> Click the link below to commence the 20-minute online assessment. If the assessment concludes that you are entitled to a de minimis exemption, we'll prepare a bespoke BNG Exemption Report for you which you can download as soon as you complete the assessment. This comprehensive report, which will include a metric sheet and habitat maps, will help you demonstrate to your Local Planning Authority (LPA) that your development is exempt from BNG, in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). </p>
 <p><strong>Get a Detailed BNG Exemption Report</strong> </p>
 <p> <strong>Price:</strong> £75 (excluding VAT). </p>
 <p> <strong>Payment Note: </strong> You only pay if your site is confirmed as exempt! </p>
 <p> <strong>Alternatively,</strong> if the assessment concludes that you're not eligible for a de minimis exemption or wish to proceed differently, <strong>you can utilise our end-to-end Biodiversity Net Gain Too </strong>l and fully comply with BNG online. Remember, adhering to BNG not only enhances the local environment but can also improve your chances of obtaining planning permission. </p>
