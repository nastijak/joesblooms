    <label> GOOD NEWS - we can help prove that your application is EXEMPT.</label>
    <p> Based on the information you have provided, our preliminary assessment is that your development may be exempt from having to comply with mandatory BNG obligation. Our tool can produce a bespoke BNG Exemption Report, which will allow you to demonstrate to your Local Planning Authority that you are exempt and have undertaken an assessment of your duties under Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). </p>
<p>Get a detailed BNG Exemption Report(£35)</p>
 <p>(It only takes 20 minutes!)</p>
 <p>Note that Local Planning Authorities (LPAS) can still request that an application complies with BNG. Complying
with BNG also enhances the local environment and can boost the chances of getting planning permission.</p>

    <p>Biodiversity Net Gain will not apply to Biodiversity Gain Sites. Article 7 of The Biodiversity Gain Requirements (Exemptions) Regulations 2024 states that "The biodiversity gain planning condition does not apply in relation to planning permission for development which is undertaken solely or mainly for the purpose of fulfilling, in whole or in part, the biodiversity gain planning condition which applies in relation to another development".</p>

    <label>You MIGHT be eligible for an exemption, but we need to undertake a more detailed assessment of your site to see if you eligible for a de minimis exemption.</label>
    <p>Based on the information you have provided, our preliminary assessment is that you may want to consider whether your development is eligible
for a de minimis exemption. However, to determine whether your development is eligible, we need to work out how many habitats your
development will "impact" as determined by the statutory biodiversity metric.</p>
    <p>The good news is that we can undertake this assessment, online in under 45 minutes.<p/>
    <p>Our tool can produce a bespoke BNG Exemption Report, which will allow you to demonstrate to your Local Planning Authority that you are
exempt and have undertaken an assessment of your duties under Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). The plan will include detailed reasons, a baseline and a post-development habitat map.<p/>
