If the assessment concludes that you are entitled to a de minimis exemption, we'll prepare a bespoke BNG Exemption Report for you which you can download as soon as you complete the assessment. This comprehensive report, which will include a metric sheet and habitat maps, will help you demonstrate to your Local Planning Authority (LPA) that your development is exempt from BNG, in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). </p>

    <p>Despite being classified as a "major" development, our preliminary assessment is that your
project may still qualify for a de minimis exemption if it has minimal impact on local habitats. Given the scale and complexity of your project, a comprehensive 45-minute online assessment is required to determine this.</p>
    <p><strong>Next Steps: </strong></p>
   <p> <strong>Initiate the In-Depth Assessment:</strong> Click the link below to start the 45-minute assessment. Upon completion, if your site is eligible for a de minimis exemption, you will receive a bespoke BNG Exemption Report. This detailed report includes a metric sheet and habitat maps, facilitating your demonstration to the Local Planning Authority (LPA) that your major development meets the exemption criteria from Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) as outlined in Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).</p>
